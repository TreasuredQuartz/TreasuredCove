- At least a party of four have joined the quest prior to the player joining.
- It will be explained that there was a nearby goblin scouting party, and it is suspected that they may have kidnapped or killed children of the town.
- The goal of the quest is to find the children and bring them back (alive) if possible.
- The party will track the scouting group to a far off goblin encampment at the entrance to a cave.
- This marks the first encounter of the quest.
	1. A small squadron of Goblins sit outside the Cave's entrance. Depending on the team's progress, they may be tired and not want a skirmish. Taking a significant amount of time will result in more Goblins being present and more willing to fight. 
	2. 
- After clearing the encounter, the children are not within the camp, and there is one child's body within the entrance to the cave that is lifeless, a detail meant to draw the players in.
