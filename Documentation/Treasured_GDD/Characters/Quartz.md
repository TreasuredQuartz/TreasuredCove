# Who is it about?

The Immortal Creator — He is the brother of 3 others, and they embark on a quest together to save missing villagers in their town. They track a suspect to a cave in the cold forest, after they explore inside to discover a cursed artifact and a Lich, the four brothers are separated from life. Quartz uses the magical item to save his brethren’s lives by inflicting each one with a curse. They remain lifeless while they remain outside of their ideal fantasies, aside from Quartz who fantasizes about building each of their ideal dreams into reality.

# What does he want?

Quartz wants his family to stay together. He draws the stuff of dreams from his mind and then transforms them into reality. His home has become a factory for building out the foundations of the world. The people, their customs, their weapons, the sky beyond — he created them.

He wants to create originality, but everything he creates comes from somewhere else.

# Why can’t he get it?

He fantasizes about becoming a master builder and mastering the secrets of the universe, but recognizes that it isn’t realistic— instead taking solace in the time with people around him. After being inflicted with the curse, he no longer can spend time with his loved ones, as he is compelled to follow his deepest desire to remain alive.

# What does he do about it?

Over time, he builds any different fantasies for his loved ones and family, but this isn’t satisfying him as each of them live in separate spaces without contact. He tries many different methods:

- Finding for himself different levels of immortality to survive outside his fantasy.
- Creating monsters designed to destroy the barriers between his family.
- Growing artificial clones using his DNA that would be able to leave.

# Why doesn’t that work?

The cursed object’s condition overrides other forms of immortality, as the user is considered as a dream manifest and no longer as an “alive“ entity. This means that any “immortal” effects gained by the dream, would end just as the dream ends as well.

Physical beings (even manifested by dream beings), cannot remove the barriers between reality and dream. Destroying themselves, their homes, or anything of the physical realm would not affect the isolation of the dream realms.

Growing artificial clones using DNA doesn’t transfer the memories of the original, and even if the memories were transferred in a separate process, the original dream manifest would remain cursed; defeating the purpose.

# How does it end?
