# Who is it about?

Yasedase, is a singularity among characters. Granted a fiendish power, transformed into a creature known as a ghoul, she claims ownership of the Star Destroyer in the atmosphere of an ice planet within the Dead Galaxy dungeon.

# What does she want?

She dreams of gaining ownership over her own force crystal.

# Why can't she get it?

Force crystals only form within the ice caverns of a certain ice planet in the solar system. They respond to the force sensitivity of the user that they resonate with.

# What does she do about it?

She takes command of a Star Destroyer and directs it overhead of the ice planet so she might head an expedition into their caverns.

# Why doesn't that work?



# How does it end?
