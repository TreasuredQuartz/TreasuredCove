### **Elevator Pitch**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">A quick 2-3 sentence overview of your game. Include a hook, genre of your game, and a few gameplay actions.</span>

A world of living progression; based on the old PlayStation Magazine demo series— this game strives to provide a open world play space that connects unique separate games together.

### **Unique Selling Point/The Twist**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">What makes your game special or different from the competitor within your game’s genre?</span>

This game doesn't fit inside of a box that another game has already taken. Skyrim is first person, and the gameplay is intended to be very similar, but the world is static in a lot of ways that ***Treasured*** is not. 
Conversely, Civilization V (or other city builder type games), tend to not allow the "player" to participate in the world aside from a Godlike guidance; which ***Treasured*** is explicitly about playing alongside the world as it grows and changes.
### **Design Pillars**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">List 1-5 core principles your game design decisions will be based on. Designs and features will be filtered through whether or not they align with these design pillars.</span>

**General Game Design Rules:**

- A game should be _**fun.**_
- A game should be _**interactive.**_
- A game should be _**easy to pick-up**_ and _**difficult to master.**_

**My Specific Game Design Rules:**

- Evolving world — The game world should change over time.
- Player freedom — Allowing players to craft a unique experience is essential.
- Artistic Ascetic — The art direction is explicitly against realism.

### **Core System Mechanics**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">List 3-4 gameplay systems built off your design pillars. System mechanics should translate to gameplay that create experiences aligning with your design pillars.</span>

- An Inner World — A fully customizable Hex world where every tile represents a class or skill tree the player has access to, as well as secrets that are revealed over time.
- Customizable Dungeons — Every dungeon can have outside components added in to it, such as creatures, items, or even room layouts; allowing them to be included when next procedurally generated.
- A Metroidvania World — Areas are gated off with the requirement of specific abilities or items to explore past them.

### **Story Elements**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">List 3-4 key story elements that lead to gameplay actions (Why and what makes the player do X).  This is NOT a complete plot summary of your game.</span>

- Players traverse a world in search of dungeons in hopes of obtaining their legendary treasure.
- Every dungeon is unique, in terms of gameplay and objective, but they share in common the singular present force throughout the dungeon that must be defeated to complete them.

### **Supplemental Art**

<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic">3 images that illustrate the mood, genre, or gameplay. These images can be annotated screenshots of similar games, concept art thumbnails, or basic sketches. Can be updated later.</span>
