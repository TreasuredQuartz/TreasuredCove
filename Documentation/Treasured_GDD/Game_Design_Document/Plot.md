## Chapter 1

A beautiful hillside with fresh cut grass and dew hanging off every leaf in the forest below. A solitary tree boasts long branches, and a thick trunk, relative to its prolonged life, and a fellow waking to a sudden possession. They could still experience their senses, but control had been wrested away from them, and they stood unmoving inside of the moment. After a brief pause to absorb their surroundings, the first step of many was taken to breech into the new world.

To the right, a brother to the hill. Surrounded by forest, a mountainous landmark could be seen ahead, and rushing water could be heard from behind. “Welcome,” a high pitch squeal gave rise to a comforting voice, “take your time to look around, then head back to the village.” How long had it been; the plants retained their dew and the moment felt as though it could never end? Once the footsteps began, they continued amongst the thoughts deciding the best direction to continue their course. Walking in circles at different speeds and constantly changing the radius and location of the offset from which they would spin, but after hearing the voice it seemed as though one’s feet had made a decision to head toward the stream of water.

Although it seemed like morning, and every sense of perception proclaimed that it must have rained recently, one’s body remained dry. With every step, they would curl their toes, digging into the moist earth and experiencing the sensation of a chilly morning’s ground after rain. Sounds of the stream came ever closer and the sight of a clearing came into view; however the mind continued to dwell on it’s own inner thoughts. _Why did nothing exist before that moment?_ Acting autonomously and ignorant of it’s own subconscious thoughts, the body breeched the clearing.

Trees curled around the edges and grass extended until the middle where a middling river bypassed the forest stretching toward the east and north-west. _How come I am not wet, and I cannot recall the rain?_ Having reached a clearing, and the sound of rushing water was visually confirmed, the body hesitated… then continued to the water. Grass transitioned into mud then rocks, pebbles, and finally that rushing crystal clear liquid that creatures depended on for survival. Even without the need for quenching their thirst, the body knelt by the stream and cupped water to bring forth to their lips. _Who or what was that voice? Why didn’t I look toward the speaker?_ Water ran down their arms, and into their throat. _I should go back, back to the two hills and the voice._ The body stopped drinking.

Another moment began, one that lasted longer than any one before it. Legs and arms frozen; suspended in time and unyielding to the thoughts within. _Come on, move! What’s happened to my body?_ Slowly, standing up, it was reveled that across from the river, wolves had begun to emerge from the forest. _Run!_ The thoughts cried out, but the body was under a new master now, one that couldn’t hear or ignored the commands. The body raised it’s fists and a leading wolf plunged fully into the clearing and toward its prey.

The quest was to be accepted; the invitation was for each potential member to arrive at the local tavern between the morning and evening of the day. On arrival, there was a particular man who appeared to be regarded as the leader or manager of the quest.
