# Some ground rules:

1. Older Players will maintain social standings.
2. New and returning players will not be gatekept from newer content.
3. New and returning players cannot be overwhelmed.
4. There will be a cash limit that will prevent players from spending obscene amounts within a certain time frame.

_**Monetization Rules:**_

- Players are not _**USERS**_ — Monetary practices are not to be tied to addictive habits or behaviors.
- Players are _**GRATEFUL**_ — All purchases are to based on supporting the development of the game or the franchise.

_**VIPs and Casuals:**_

- All players are Casuals. Casuals transition to VIPs after crossing a spending threshold In-game.
- VIP players do not spend any additional money on the game, and receive all previous available purchases for free. VIPs transition back to Casuals at the start of the next monetary season.

Destiny 2 features a $400 catchup in content. Veteran players pay $60 with every expansion, and have payed this full amount over the course of every release. However, after the expansion comes out, the previous expansion is no longer new and it’s value has become outdated, but the price has not been updated to reflect it’s new value. I suggest a new practice in which every subsequent seasonal release will be included in the newest seasonal bundle.

Effectively, players can pay for the newest campaign and receive all previous campaigns with it. This removes most “Gatekeeping” that this practice creates towards new or returning players.

# Battle-pass System?

Will [Treasured](https://www.notion.so/Treasured-6c4ed807b5784e39b865998fba024a65?pvs=21) feature a battle-pass system? In a traditional sense, yes. There will be a cosmetic system in place in which players will receive luxuries relative to the amount of in-game time played. These passes will be released at a seasonal rate for a time, and be available for free during their seasons, after which they will then be available in the in-game store. All passes cannot have their individual tiers purchased and must be obtained via time-spent, additionally there will be no purchasable items to speed up the completion of pass tiers. Passes will be optimized to require 4 hours of playtime a day, everyday, for the duration of the season (however long that may be), excluding any modifiers or bonuses, to complete in entirety.

## Legacy-passes

These passes will feature exclusive content from older versions of the game. They can be purchased and then activated to run alongside the current free seasonal pass. After a year, all seasonal passes from that year will be consolidated into a single pass for the same price as a single pass.

# Rest-System

Players will build up an experience multiplier over the course of a month during inactive periods of time. After logging in, the experience multiplier will be applied and deteriorate during in-game time played.

# Expansions

There are no plans currently for future content expanding the single/co-op player experience.

# In-Game Shop

The primary shop may have limited daily options for real money. After buying 5 of these items, the player will reach VIP status.

## Community Shops

Every player will be given the opportunity to create their own monetized practice.

In-Game content should be able to be created via [Forge](https://www.notion.so/Forge-6eb4a812dcc94b12a099a13e93ec5a88?pvs=21) mechanic and then traded for real money within the community shop.

This content will be exclusive to multiplayer and non-competitive game modes.

VIP status may possibly apply in a limited manner to Community Content.

# Q&A:

## Q. How many Seasons do you have planned?

A. None atm.

## Q. How long will each season last?

A. I am thinking about making enough seasonal content before release to fuel 12 Month long seasons. After a year of release, I will make no plans until after I have released.
