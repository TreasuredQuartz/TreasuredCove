## General Game Design Pillars
These pillars describe how a typical game in the industry is defined. Breaking these rules might result in a product that is ill-received.
- A game should be _**fun.**_
- A game should be _**interactive.**_
- A game should be _**easy to pick-up.**_
- A game should _**reward players for their time.**_

While the first two pillars may seem like the very definition of a game itself, the last two are less self-explanatory. A game should be simple for a general broad audience to be able to play and understand at a basic level, but a game needs to be complex and difficult enough to retain and entertain long-term players.

## Treasured Design Pillars
These pillars describe the fundamental rules that Treasured follows; all systems, decisions, and further designs should stem from the core pillars.
1. Evolving world — The game world should change over time.
2. Player freedom — Allowing players to craft a unique experience is essential.
3. Artistic Ascetic — The art direction is explicitly against photo-realism.
4. Limitations are fun — Players need to be challenged to feel like they are learning.
5. Gamified Item Management — Inventory management should be considered its own game.
6. Intuitive Controls — Controls should be simplified for usage.
7. Complex Inputs — Combining inputs should have different actions.
