# Who is it about?

Mudskipper is one of the brothers in the quest: The Missing Children. He is the oldest member of the party and seen as the leader, strategizing their approach in combat.
After the quest's completion, he becomes a Dungeon Master of the Monster Region; taking on the role of a professor. He is researching the Monsters in the region and employs the player for help in that task.

# What does he want?
He wants to discover the secrets of the world; currently focusing on the spiritual influences on the real world.
# Why can’t he get it?
As a living being, Mudskipper has no access to spiritual energy, but can see other spirits.
# What does he do about it?
Cerith Szzenith, the Black Dragon, is a Vasto Lorde that lives in two separate forms due to his resurrection.
This abnormally high spiritual pressure is being leaked out around him-- causing abnormalities in the environment.
These abnormalities are tracked and researched by Mudskipper, leading him to Szzenith's lair.
# Why doesn’t that work?
Reaching Szzenith results in the end of the research party and Mudskipper's life.
# How does it end?
