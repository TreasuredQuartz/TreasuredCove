## Character List

[[Quartz]] â€” Dungeon Boss

## Background Overview
___
A copy of the Palace Of Versailles. As he builds it, the palace can be visited at various times of construction. A mist of cold, a shroud of freeze lays upon the area. Underneath, there are machinations for sustaining life forms.

## Gameplay
___

The Palace Of Versailles features round-based Call-Of-Duty Zombies gameplay; using the lifeless husks that Quartz leaves behind. Players must earn respect by damaging zombies, so they can buy doors, weapons, perks and more. As the boss, Quartz can only be defeated by completing a series of Easter Egg steps that are not told to the player.

### Locations

The Immortal Manor has a room layout based on The Palace Of Versailles. Progression through these rooms is separate from the layout itself.
### Upgrades

The player loses access to all weapons upon starting the dungeon; forced to begin with only a weak M1911 pistol and a knife as old Call-Of-Duty zombies maps often did. Then, they can purchase various upgrades present on the map.
