# Character List

[Quartz](Quartz.md) â€” Dungeon Boss

# Background Overview
___
A copy of the Palace Of Versailles. As he builds it, the palace can be visited at various times of construction. A mist of cold, a shroud of freeze lays upon the area. Underneath, there are machinations for sustaining life forms.

# Gameplay
___

The Palace Of Versailles features round-based Call-Of-Duty Zombies gameplay; using the lifeless husks that Quartz leaves behind. Players must earn respect by damaging zombies, so they can buy doors, weapons, perks and more. As the boss, Quartz can only be defeated by completing a series of Easter Egg steps that are not told to the player.

## Locations

The Immortal Manor has a room layout based on The Palace Of Versailles. Progression through these rooms is separate from the layout itself.
## Upgrades

The player loses access to all weapons upon starting the dungeon; forced to begin with only a weak M1911 pistol and a knife as old Call-Of-Duty zombies maps often did. Then, they can purchase various upgrades present on the map.

#### Crafting System

6 Groups.

Element 115


Eggs/Berries/Potatoes/Grain
Milk/Water
New/Fermented
Normal/Carbonized

Gin uses grains and juniper berries
Whiskey uses malted grains
Brandy uses fermented fruit juice
Vodka uses potatoes, or sometimes grains or beets
Tequila and mezcal both use the blue agave and other agave varieties
Rum uses sugarcane juice or molasses
Absinthe uses medicinal herbs and plants, including anise and fennel

Madeira, a Portuguese white wine
Sherry, a Spanish white wine that is often used in cooking
Vermouth, a white or red wine flavored with aromatic herbs and typically used in martinis

A mineral that is solid at the temperature and pressure of Earth's surface, embedded within it's mantle. Color changes from red, to green, to blue.

- Solid Divinium -> Mixable to make Gobblegums or Processed into Liquid
- Liquid Divinium -> Mixable with syrup to make perks or processed into Plasma.
- Nebulium Plasma -> Creates Elixirs.

***Concoction Process***

Mix 2 parts sugar and Liquid Divinium over high heat until sugar is dissolved to make a simple syrup. Combine simple syrup with an ingredient to make a specific perk-a-cola syrup.

***Syrups:***

Carbonization:
- Soda - water
- Cola - non-water
Straight:
- Brew - fermented
- Tonic - immediate

Mixing a syrup with anything and carbonizing it results in a Soda or a Cola, otherwise, using a New syrup results in a Tonic and using an Old (fermented) syrup results in a Brew.

Examples:
- New syrup = Tonic
- Old syrup = Brew
- Syrup + water + Carbonization = Soda
- Syrup + non-water + Carbonization = Cola
