# Backstory Overview
___
This world was ripped from it's vestiges and floats in the atmosphere out-of-sight from its original planet. It is trapped in a temporal sphere that allows for thousands of years to potentially pass in the span of seconds, allowing the new world to develop and redevelop for as long or as many times as is necessary. The purpose is purely experimental, with the theory being to learn: knowledge from interacting with a far more advanced civilization, and knowledge of the potential decisions and crossroads that lead to a civilization's demise.

# World Organization

## World Map
This section details the concept art and implementation of the world. The game takes place on a large floating island divided into regions as so:

> The style is to be akin to a world map drawn by Tolkien or for a DND campaign. There should be labels for each landmark as I describe.
>
> A floating island in the sky, surrounded by clouds. 
> There is a distinct Upper Region and Lower Region, separated by a waterfall. 
>
> The Center of the Upper Region is a singular inactive volcanic mountain, surrounded by hills, valleys, rivers, and crags. 
> To the Right the Upper Region is a mixture of grassland, sparse oak forest, and barren desert. This area is labeled "Coliseum."
> At the Front of the Upper Region is the culmination of rivers into a wide waterfall that spans the entire width of the Center region. This area is labeled "Waterfall."
> To the Left of the Upper Region is a pine tree forest, that comes to a clearing at a large lake.  The forest region is labeled "Gehennam" and the Lake is labeled "Lake Frost."
> At the back of the Upper Region is a barren desert with many sand dunes, a singular Oasis with palm trees, and a light house at the very edge of the island. This area is labeled "Barren Dunes."
>
> The Lower region is comprised of two islands separated by rivers created from the Waterfall. They resemble a deformed Yin-Yang symbol, as though they are two halves of one another. 
>
> The Left island is a mixture of grasslands, and golden larch forests. The forest area is labelled "Watt Forest"
> The Right island has a linear interpretation of a mountainous area and a cliffside, with forests and safaris in between. The Mountainous area is labelled "Doom Crags," and the Cliffside is labelled "Elite Four."

	1. The town closest to the home of the Elite Four and Champion. Heavenly Gym.
	2. An in-between town reliant on trading and tourism from their neighbors. Gem Gym.
	3. A mining outpost that digs precious metals and makes expeditions into the dangerous unknown crags towards the nearby mountain. Volcanic Gym.
	4. A city constructed on top the water from the bridging of nearby ships. It is a vast harbor, and is constantly rife with life traveling to-and-fro between the islands. Water/Watt Gym.
	5. The farthest city in culture from all others. It is filled with criminals and dark plots. Deprived Gym.
	6. A lumbar harvesting city, that is steeped into electricity. Wood/Watt Gym.
	7. The starting town; it is the main receiving port from the twin island, and it houses the last gym after all others have been beaten. Mud Gym.

## World States
As the design pillars dictate, this world is not static; as such it contains certain aspects that change over time. 

[Weather](./Weather) — Dynamic temperature, humidity, and wind speeds that creates various weather patterns. The weather will change throughout the days, nights, and seasons.

[[Day/Night Cycle]] — A sun and moon revolve around the outer world, creating a clock based system. This is affected by the current season: as it may be day longer than it is night, vise versa, or perfectly half-and-half.

[Ecosystems](Ecosystems.md) — Environments are built with cohesive plant and wild life in mind.

[[Seasons]] — Environments follow a cycle of seasons based on the current sun/moon rotation. The seasons can affect the length of the day/night cycle, the temperature, weather, and wildlife throughout the world. 

[[Towns]] — The first playthrough, all cities and towns are intentionally placed and designed. They all will be at some form of initial start, and grow to a defined end point.

[[Civilizations]] — Over a grand period of time, civilizations will develop, change, and be destroyed. This will affect the various towns, cities, and ecosystems in the world; as the values held by the Civilization will affect the customs of its people and naturally change the world around them.

[Dungeons](Dungeons.md) — Throughout the world, there will also be various dungeons that may be accessed. They can provide resources, challenges, and advance the story or plot if you will.

[[Magic]] — While not predominate, it is necessary to include that magic does exist within this world. There are specific locations that have more potential magical energy than others, as well as: items, materials, and creatures that are magical.
### Start State

Every Civilization (and therefore the towns they own), start with the bare minimum knowledge for creating buildings, and one Capital City.

Gehennam, and Lipis Mas Equis are the only cities to be guaranteed creations at the start of every playthrough.

### End State

The end of one Civilization can only come at the hands of another Civilization, through the collection of towns and cities. Once a Civilization has lost ownership over their Capital City, it is considered a "Dead Civilization," and their people may be interacted with until they too also meet their end.
