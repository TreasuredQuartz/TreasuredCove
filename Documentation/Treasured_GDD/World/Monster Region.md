There's 29 species, Watt forest with environmental creatures, Mountain with legendary story encounter (professor), and more. Creatures are stored in decoration gems, that are then used in slots that armor have.

### Elemental Types

[[Watt Archetype]]

[[Volcanic Archetype]]

After receiving your first creature, Professor Mudkip’s son, the champion, beats the shit out of you and knocks you unconscious. You wake up in the first town, stripped of all of your belongings. You must then defeat all 7 Gyms, spread across 2 islands, then after defeating the Champion, the professor betrays you, capturing the legendary and must be challenged.

## Completion

Professor Mudskipper fights with the legendary Pokemon until it is defeated, then dies alongside the creature. He then ascends like as a Soul Reaper from Bleach, wielding a rose-themed Scythe as his Zanpakto.
