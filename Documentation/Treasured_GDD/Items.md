# Weapons
## Ranged

These weapons are defined by their ability to launch projectiles. Typically, they are strong due to their long-range capabilities and often far weaker or worse in melee range than a melee weapon.

### Bows

A Bow is a ranged-weapon that launches arrows.

### Guns

A Gun is a complex tool using springs, levers, and typically, chemical stored potential energy, to launch small projectiles at subsonic or supersonic speeds.

#### Standardization

Manufacturers will eventually come to a set standard regarding weapons. The following categories will have their own parts, and ammunition designed for each other.

1. **Feeding**: A cartridge is stripped from a magazine (semi-automatics, lever and bolt-action rifles) or manually placed (single-shot bolt-action rifles, break-open shotguns, and revolvers) against a bolt or breech face.

2. **Chambering**: The cartridge, held in place by the extractor, is pushed into the barrel chamber by the bolt (rifles, semi-auto shotguns) or breech face (semi-auto pistols, lever-action rifles, break-open shotguns).  Revolver ammunition is rotated into place by the movement of the cylinder.

3. **Locking**: The bolt/breech face/cylinder is locked into position with the bore/barrel.  Through locking, the mechanical alignment of the major parts within the firearm will ensure gas expansion is captured and focused on propelling the bullet through the bore and ensuring the operation of a semi-auto firearm.  Once locked, the weapon is ready to fire.

4. **Firing**: A trigger press rotates the sear, which sends the firing pin or striker against the primer, causing ignition of the powder.  This results in gas expansion within the chambered cartridge which propels the projectile into and through the barrel bore.

5. **Unlocking**: In semi-automatic weapons, the gas expansion causes a backward movement of the bolt (rifles/shotguns) or slide/breech face (pistols) unseating the cartridge case from the chamber and engaging the disconnector (which prevents fully automatic fire).  In bolt and lever action rifles,  pump and break-open shotguns, and revolvers, the shooter manually performs the unlocking.

6. **Extraction**: Continued backward movement of the bolt or slide/breech face in semi-automatic weapons causes the extractor to “pull” the cartridge case out of the chamber.  Again, the shooter manually performs this action in other types of guns.

7. **Ejection**: Prior to the termination of backward movement of the bolt or slide/breech face, the cartridge case being pulled by the extractor comes in contact with the ejector which “pushes” the spent cartridge case through the ejection port.

8. **Cocking**: During the backward movement of the bolt or slide/breech face while extraction/ejection is taking place, the hammer or striker is engaged by the sear and cocked for the resumption of the cycle of operations.  The shooter manually performs this action in other types of weapons.  Note: In double action and double action/single action guns, cocking and firing are incorporated into the action of the trigger pull.

## Melee

These weapons are defined by their usage entailing contact from the item itself against the target, as opposed to launching a secondary item to make contact.

### Edges

Any weapon that finds use through the usage of a deadly edge for slicing, cutting, and piercing.

### Blunts

Any weapon that has no edge, and is instead defined by the blunt force trauma it can be used to inflict.
